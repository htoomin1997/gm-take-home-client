=======Notes=======  
The front end is a fairly standard react affair. Even though it was not specified, I thought that adding in some sort of loading spinner was good for user interaction; don't want the user to sit and not see anything happen for a while. 

I chose to add in redux, because I really like keeping the store and the component logic separate, although a custom hook would have probably worked just as well. 

The CSS is probably what took me the most time actually; just researching the types of colors to use and doing a deep dive on what font was used by Giant Machines. I think I found it!

I included an endpoint to add information on the backend, but the prompt did not say anything about adding in a field on the front end to be able to interact with that endpoint. And so, in the vein of trying to replicate the image as much as possible, I did not include it.

Because this is only going to be running locally, I have not packaged the react, and will instead run the react normally.

=======Running Instructions=======  
Build Environment: MacOS  
ASSUMING THAT THE SERVER IS RUNNING ON PORT 8080  

1. Run "npm install" to install all dependencies.
2. Run "npm start" to run the client.

Something that I want to note is that my local keychain points to hm1487 which is an old github account that I no longer want to use, but I want to point out that that is still my account and that this is all my work!

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I hope you enjoy my project!
